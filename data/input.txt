Detective in fedora stands in rainy alley, minimal movement, steady shot

Rain falls steadily on brick walls, locked camera, slow motion

Detective walks slowly forward, smooth movement, stable frame

Detective pauses under streetlight, very subtle motion, fixed camera

Detective faces forward into darkness, barely moving, static composition
