A lone figure in a fedora and trench coat steps into the narrow alley, rain streaking down dark fabric.
Shadows pool against wet brick walls, shifting as distant streetlight flickers through the downpour.
The detective's footsteps echo against slick pavement, each step slow and cautious.
They pause beneath a dying lamp, steam rising from a grate and obscuring their face.
The alley stretches ahead into blackness, rain falling steady as the figure moves forward into shadow.
