A lone figure steps into a narrow alleyway, rain sliding down their coat in silver streaks.
Dim neon from a distant sign flickers across wet brick walls, pulsing like a heartbeat.
Each footstep echoes against the puddles, a rhythm swallowed by the hum of the city beyond.
They pause beneath a flickering lamp, steam rising from a nearby vent and curling around their silhouette.
For a moment, the world narrows to rain, breath, and the quiet promise of something waiting at the alley's end.
