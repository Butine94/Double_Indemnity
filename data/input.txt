A lone figure in a fedora and trench coat steps into the narrow alley, rain streaking down dark fabric, static camera, consistent lighting, stable composition.

Shadows pool against wet brick walls, steady shot, unchanging perspective, rain falling consistently.

The detective's footsteps echo against slick pavement, camera locked on figure, stable frame, even lighting throughout.

They pause beneath a dying lamp, motionless camera, consistent atmospheric fog, steady rain.

The alley stretches ahead into blackness, fixed camera position, rain falling at constant rate, stable framing.
